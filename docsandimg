Notes : 

Image path is assumed as folder location and Item Id.jpeg

Image path and other things are hard coded for demo only, can be fetch from configs. 

Image path can be stored in DB as it is based on full path or combination of actual and virtual paths. 	

Image as a file in Output needs to convert i.e. desrialize base64 string back to file to be used.
